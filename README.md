# Social-Media-Friend-Tracker App

The Social Media Friend Tracker App is a tool designed to help users track and manage their relationships with friends they make on multiple social media platforms. The app was originally built as a Todo list app and was then converted into a Social Media Friend Tracker app.

The app provides a centralized location for storing and updating information about friends, including their names, the platform on which they were met, and the date and time of the meeting. It includes a custom RESTFUL API backend that supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to add, view, update, and delete information about their friends.

The app integrates with multiple social media platforms, using a custom RESTFUL API to gather information about a user's friends and populate the friend database
